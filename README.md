# Linear-Regression

NAME : MURARI YAMINI

DESCRIPTION : This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict house prices 

based on property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and stories.

TOOLS USED :

scikit-learn,pandas,numpy,matplotlib

DATASET USED : housing dataset

STEPS INVOLVED :

1.Data Loading - read the housing dataset using pandas

2.Data Preprocessing - selected only few features

3.Train-Test Split - dataset splited(60% training &40% testing)

4.Model Training - trained Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression

5.Model Evaluation - calculated 

MAE(Mean Absolute Error)

MSE(Mean Squared Error)

RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² score

6.visualization - A bar plot was generated to visualize the  each feature (coefficient values) on the target 

price using matplotlib.
